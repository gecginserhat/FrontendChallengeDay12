Day 12: JavaScript Loops, Window Object & Scope <br/>

🔁 Day 12 of my 21-day coding challenge, and today I dove into some essential JavaScript concepts that make code execution more efficient and dynamic. Here's a quick breakdown:<br/>

🔄 Loops (While, Do While, For): Mastered different looping structures to execute code repeatedly based on conditions. These loops are essential for iterating over arrays, handling repetitive tasks, and more.<br/>

🖼️ Window Object: Gained a solid understanding of the Window object, which represents the browser window and allows access to numerous properties and methods (like alert(), prompt(), and location).<br/>

🌍 Scope (Global, Function, Block): Learned about how variable scope works in JavaScript, from global to function and block scope, helping write cleaner and more predictable code.<br/>

Excited to build more complex logic tomorrow!<br/>
